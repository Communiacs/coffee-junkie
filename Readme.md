# Make a career as a developer with Communiacs


The development of individual web applications is your world? Are you excited about the new technical possibilities of the digital age? Then you have come to the right place!

Show us your talent and you are only a few lines of code away from a career with Communiacs. Test your technical know-how with a small training project.

As in all digital agencies, coffee is the fuel that drives development. Convince us with the implementation of a small Vue.js PWA to automate coffee orders.

You will find a file `pwa-screenshot.png` in the main folder. This serves as a guideline for the implementation.


## Components

### Headless API with symfony
Convince us with your Symfony knowledge and create a new Symfony 4 application in the folder `api` via Composer. 

The application should be adapted in a way that it does not deliver HTML output, but can only be accessed via a RESTful API.
In this demo it is enough for us to create a single READ-ONLY endpoint that returns all beverage types (cappuccino, espresso, coffee and water) with the necessary entities as JSON. 

To cover more advanced topics like security, access restrictions, ... you do not need to worry about. 

### Vue.js Progressive Web App
As a second step we would like to get to know your strength in frontend development. Please create a new Vue.js application in the `vuejs` folder. Please orientate yourself by the visual suggestion in `pwa-screenshot.png`. 

The output of the drinks should be done dynamically using the previously created endpoint from the Symfony application.
You only have to optimize the output for smartphone and tablet.

Necessary icons and pictures are provided in the `vuejs` folder.

### What we expect
You will find a file `Documentation.md` in both project folders `api` and `vuejs`. We would like to be able to understand how you approached the individual steps and how you finally implemented the requirements. Please roughly document your steps of implementation there.

If you are satisfied with your results, please create a zip file from the entire project and send it by e-mail to `w.freund@communiacs.de`. We are looking forward to your input and always hold a seat for you.

## To all junior and intermediate coding professionals out there
If something should be unclear for you, or questions arise, you can always contact us at `w.freund@communiacs.de`. By the way, if you are experienced in implementing TYPO3 or Shopware projects, we should meet anyway.
